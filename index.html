                        <p>✨ A small step today, but a big part of my journey ahead!
I’m really excited to share that I have completed the “Learn Full Stack Web Development” course by Codedamn on the Cursa platform.
When I first started learning web development, I was curious about how websites actually work — from the design that we see on the screen to the logic that runs behind the scenes. This course gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into both frontend and backend development, helping me connect the dots and build complete web applications.
💡 Through this learning journey, I strengthened my skills in:
 ✅ HTML & CSS – building responsive, user-friendly designs
 ✅ JavaScript – bringing interactivity to the web
 ✅ Backend concepts – understanding how servers, databases, and APIs connect everything together
But more than just technical knowledge, this course taught me discipline, patience, and the importance of continuous learning in tech. Every small project I built boosted my confidence and reminded me why I chose this path in the first place.
I know this is just the beginning of a long road, but milestones like this motivate me to keep moving forward and growing every day. 🚀
